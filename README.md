# scroll-to-accept
Vanilla JS project from Wes Bos's class: how to enable Accept button when user scrolled all the way down to read Terms and Conditions

## How
There are 2 ways to do it: the old way is to listen for the Scroll event.  The new way is to use the Intersection Observer API, a much better way.
